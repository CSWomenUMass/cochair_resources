Hello, CS Women Members!

We will be holding our usual checkin/office hours/scrum/hack session at 4pm today in CS303. Whether you are an officer looking to get some CS Women work done and out of the way, or a member who just wants to chat about some CS Women-related things, stop on by when you get the chance.
